For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.    1\n",

Supervisor offered solutions advice time/energy to get help if I ever felt that needed it. (though it would have to be at my own expense). I feel safe sharing personal info with this particular person/company but this environment is the exception rather than the norm in my 15 years as a tech worker. I would never feel safe enough to reveal info about any mental health concerns with any previous employers in the tech industry for fear of  negative perceptions job loss performance dings etc.                                                                                     1\n",
