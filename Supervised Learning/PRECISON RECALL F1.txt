🧠 When to Choose Precision or Recall
✅ Choose Precision when:
False Positives are costly

You want to be very sure about positive predictions

📌 Examples:
Spam detection: You don’t want to misclassify important emails as spam.

Medical diagnosis for rare diseases: If you predict someone has cancer, you want high certainty.

Fraud detection: Don't falsely accuse legitimate transactions.

✅ Choose Recall when:
False Negatives are costly

You want to catch all actual positives, even if it means some false alarms

📌 Examples:
Cancer screening: Better to flag someone incorrectly than to miss a real case.

Security alerts: Catch all potential intrusions, even if some are false.

Search engines: Show all possibly relevant documents (even if some are less accurate).

⚖️ When You Need a Balance: Use F1-Score
