üìò What is a Learning Curve?
A learning curve is a plot that shows how your model‚Äôs performance changes with respect to the number of training examples.

It helps you understand:

Whether your model is overfitting or underfitting

Whether more training data could improve performance

If your model is converging properly

üìä Axes of a Learning Curve:
| Axis       | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **X-axis** | Number of training samples (increasing size) |
| **Y-axis** | Model performance (accuracy, loss, etc.)     |

Usually, two curves are plotted:

Training score (on training data)

Validation score (on unseen/validation data)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìà Interpreting the Learning Curve
1. High Bias (Underfitting):
Both training and validation scores are low and close together.

Model is too simple to capture patterns.

2. High Variance (Overfitting):
Training score is high, but validation score is low.

Model is too complex, performs well on training but poorly on new data.

3. Good Fit:
Training and validation scores are high and close to each other.

Indicates generalization.

üß† Why Learning Curves Matter?
| Benefit               | Use Case                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diagnose model issues | Overfitting vs. Underfitting                             |
| Improve performance   | Know when to collect more data                           |
| Compare models        | Which algorithm generalizes better                       |
| Debug learning        | Understand if model is learning too slowly or plateauing |

üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Better Learning Curves
Use cross-validation for smoother and more reliable curves.

Plot training size vs both accuracy and loss for deeper insight.

Normalize features for faster convergence and more meaningful curves.
