    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the world of machine learning, each algorithm is often viewed as a specialist. Some algorithms excel in classification tasks, such as distinguishing between cats and dogs in images, while others thrive in regression tasks, like predicting house prices or a person’s salary based on experience. But what if the roles of these algorithms weren’t so fixed? Could a classifier, typically designed to categorize, be transformed into a regressor capable of predicting continuous values? And how can we create structured workflows to handle these tasks seamlessly?\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter dives deep into how classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests can become powerful regression tools. We will also explore Transformers, Estimators, and the art of building machine-learning Pipelines, culminating in a robust framework for real-world applications.\n",

    "The Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a company is using a classifier to decide whether candidates are eligible for a particular job role. The algorithm outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on certain features, such as experience, education, and certifications. But now, the company wants to predict something different: the exact salary a candidate might deserve based on their experience. The task shifts from classification to regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, many classification algorithms can be adapted for regression tasks with minor adjustments. Let’s explore how some of these well-known algorithms work in regression mode."
